# jartbot
This is the code that runs the jartbot twitter bot found here https://twitter.com/jartbot_. 
It is built with Java, Python, and various libraries for both languages (Processing, twepy, etc).
This repository contains everything configured to my system with the exeption of the api keys.
Take a look around, and find some inspiration to make something amazing!
